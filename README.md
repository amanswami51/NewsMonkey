This news web app gives almost every category of news likes `Bussiness`, `Entertainment`, `Technology`, `Health`, `Science`, `Sports` etc. \
These categories are mentions on navbar. \
IN this website, I can insert `red color loadingBar` which gives the progress of searching and `Black color loading Icons`. \
Every category contains so many pages, for navigation of the pages I can give two buttons `Back`(left side) and `Next`(right side).
